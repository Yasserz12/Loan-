# Loan-
This Dataset contains information about customers of the Bank and whether they got accepted to take a lone or not, so using these informations I was able to build a predictive system to predict if the next customer will get accepted to get the loan or not.
in the project I did data cleaning, feature ebgineering and data visualization to see better the correlation between each feature with the output, and applying Support Vector Regression algorithm to build the predictive system, after tuning hyperparameters.
